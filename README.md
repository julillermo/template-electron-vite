A template based on a LogRocket blog post and electron-vite's online guide

This template is based on the [electron-vite](https://github.com/alex8088/electron-vite), which is licensed under the MIT License and the ["Build an Electron app with electron-vite" LogRocket blog post](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-electron-app-electron-vite/#creating-web-app-vite-react) by [Brian de Sousa](https://github.com/briandesousa/).

This template serves as the basis for my future `electron.js` projects using `electron-vite` and `react-ts`. It will continually be updated as continue to learn about `React.js`, `Vite.js`, `Electron.js`, `Node.js`, and as I continue to refine my preferences as a developer.

Feel free to use this template if it useful to you! üòÅ
